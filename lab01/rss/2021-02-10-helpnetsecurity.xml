They need to understand the attack surface has changed and operate under the assumption that the number one risk to their hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructure is a trusted identity with excessive high-risk permissions. The only way to manage that risk is to implement the principle of least privilege across their cloud environment. If not, they run the risk of compromising every security system, policy, and procedure &#8230; <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2021/02/10/whitepaper-ciem/" rel="nofollow">More <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to software security, one of the biggest challenges facing developers today is information overload. Thanks in part to the widespread proliferation and use of open-source code (a study by Red Hat showed that 36% of software in use at surveyed organizations was open source), as well as the increasing complexity of the average application, a given project can now be expected to have a massive amount of dependencies.

I’ve seen this collaboration up close due to my company’s involvement in helping to secure Super Bowl LV. The Super Bowl is designated as a National Special Security Event, which means the Department of Homeland Security and other government agencies are deeply involved.

However, new analysis by Aite Group finds the cost of synthetic fraud will rebound post-pandemic, reaching new highs. Synthetic identity fraud involves fraudsters creating fictitious identities by piecing together real identity attributes and fake information with the intent to open fraudulent accounts. “The dip in &#8230; <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2021/02/10/synthetic-fraud-cost/" rel="nofollow">More <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a></p>
