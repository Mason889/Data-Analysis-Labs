					<description><![CDATA[<p>Over the past decade, the firms that make up the so-called Big Tech have captured enough of the global economy to resemble industrial cartels from a bygone era. Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft form behemoths within their respective markets. Whether you&#8217;re an individual or a business entity, avoiding these organizations or their subsidiaries is difficult. More than likely, your personal information is regularly collected and used by several of them.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>During the past year, business leaders have seen first-hand the benefits of adopting an everywhere enterprise model of working and are now carefully considering its role in the future of work.

It is therefore unsurprising that Gartner’s research has found that 90% of HR leaders will allow employees to &#8230; <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2021/02/11/protecting-productivity-disappearing-perimeter/" rel="nofollow">More <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Guardicore released IPCDump, a new open source tool for tracing interprocess communication on Linux. The tool covers most interprocess communication (IPC) mechanisms, including pipes, fifos, signals, Unix sockets, loopback-based networking, and pseudoterminals, and is useful for debugging multi-process applications and gaining transparency into how they communicate with one another in their IT environment. Modern applications have distinct processes that plug into one another in a black box, creating significant challenges for developers when something breaks. &#8230; <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2021/02/11/ipcdump-open-source-tool/" rel="nofollow">More <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a></p>
